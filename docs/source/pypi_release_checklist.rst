PyPI Release Checklist
======================

.. note::

   See the `PyPI Common questions`_ for more information about package submission and management.

.. _`PyPI Common questions`: https://pypi.org/help/

Before Your First Release
-------------------------

#. Update any `[project.urls]` in ``pyproject.toml`` to match the documentation, homepage, and any other external URLs.

#. Ensure that the name you have chosen has not already been registered on PyPI. This can be performed by consulting the PyPI Index (https://pypi.python.org/).

#. Create accounts at both `test.pypi.org` and `pypi.org` if you don't already have them.

Trusted Publishing
------------------

`Trusted Publisher`_ is an automated and secure method for deploying new versions tagged on GitHub directly to PyPI (and TestPyPI).

#. On both TestPyPI and PyPI accounts go to: Publishing > Add a new pending publisher.

#. Fill in the form:
    * TestPyPI/PyPI Project Name: Your package name (e.g., my-package)
    * Owner: Your GitHub username or organization
    * Repository name: Your repo name
    * Workflow name:
        * TestPyPI: tag-testpypi.yml
        * PyPI: publish-pypi.yml
    * Environment name:
        * TestPyPI: "staging"
        * PyPI: "production"

#. Go to Settings > Environments > New environment and create both a "staging" and "production" environments.

.. note::

   Optionally, you can add required reviewers for specific deployments and restrict deployments to ``v*`` tags.
   This will prevent badly-named tags or accidental pushes from creating new versions automatically.

Once this is configured, all you need to do is push a new tag to the `main` branch and your package will be
automatically published to TestPyPI_, while performing a release on GitHub will then trigger an upload to PyPI_.

For Every Release
-----------------

In a new branch based off the latest commit of `main` open a Pull Request (PR):

#. Update CHANGELOG.rst under the "unreleased" entry.

#. Commit the changes:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git add CHANGELOG.rst
        $ git commit -m "Changelog for upcoming release 0.1.1."

#. Update (bump) the version number (by ``major``, ``minor``, or ``patch``)

    .. code-block:: console

        $ bump-my-version bump { major | minor | patch }

#. Push the commit to your branch:

    .. code-block:: console

       $ git push

#. Merge your branch to `main` and checkout the `main` branch locally.

#. Tag the last commit of `main` and push the tags, creating the new release on TestPyPI:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z (or any other message you want associated with the tag)"
        $ git push --tags

#. (Optionally) Check the TestPyPI listing page to make sure that the README, metadata URLs, and necessary package contents are all available and accurate.
   If not, try one of these:

    * Copy and paste the RestructuredText into an RST checker (such as https://rsted.info.ucl.ac.be/) to find out what broke the formatting.

    * Check your `long_description`` locally:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ pip install build twine
        $ python -m build --sdist --wheel
        $ python -m twine check dist/*

#. If corrections are required, merge them to `main`, bump to a new version, and create a new tag; published PyPI artifacts cannot be overwritten.

#. Prepare a release in your project's GitHub repository, pointing to the tagged version. Paste the release notes into the release page and optionally add a title.

.. note::

    For security purposes, we recommend clicking the `Enable release immutability` checkbox in your project settings page.

    This prevents maintainers and administrators from modifying a tagged version once it has been formally released.
    TestPyPI and PyPI already enable this level of security by default, so any bugged/broken versions can only be removed ("yanked"), never overwritten.

About This Checklist

This checklist is generally adapted from:

It assumes that you are using all features of `cookiecutter-birdhouse`.
